Welcome to NBA50k Card Collector!

The goal of this game is to achieve the largest net worth possible so that you can reach the highest place on the leaderboards.

Being by running with flask run. You may register an account by clicking “register” in the top right. If there is an incorrect value entered, you will be
taken to a crying Jordan meme that tells you what the error is (whenever an error is encountered, hit the back arrow to return to
the previous screen and try again). If you already have an account, you may log in straight away.

Once logged in, you will be taken to the home page. Here you will see a navbar at the top, which allows you to go to “Home”,
“Open Packs”, “Leaderboard” or to “Logout”. In the top right, you will also see your points--every user begins with 50,000.
The summary box illustrates a summary of your account: your username after “username”, the number of points you have after “points”,
the cumulative value of all the cards in your collection combined after “collection value” and your total net worth--a sum
of your collection value and your points--after “net worth”. When you first log in, your collection will be empty. However,

you may click on the open packs tap to begin opening packs.
Open Packs will direct you to a screen that says “Buy Pack For 5000 Points” and an image beneath it, which you may click on
to open a pack. Keep in mind, to open a pack 5,000 points will be subtracted from your point total. This could pay off (if
you, say, got the best player in the game: 99 overall David Malan), but it may also utterly fail. Once you click open pack,
you will receive a random NBA player, along with his stats and information. Keep in mind, you may only open a pack if you
have the points required, or else you will be prompted to a custom error screen. Underneath, two buttons will allow you to
open more packs or return back to the home screen.

If you return home, you will notice that the player you just received is now in your collection! Now, you may click on that
player in your home screen, where you will be prompted to an information screen about this player. In addition to this player’s
information, you will see a button that will allow you to sell the player for a price. Keep in mind, however, this price is
slightly less than the value of the player. This is important because your net worth is not calculated by not only your
total points, but rather your collection value + your total points. So, by selling the player you will lose some net worth.
However, selling the player will give you more points, allowing you to open more packs which will be beneficial if you’re
lucky with your pack opening.

Strategies can be figured out in the game. For example, players are more valuable in your collection than when sold for points.
However, points allow you to open more packs. Furthermore, lower-rated players sell for a higher % of their value than higher
valued players.

The final tab, the leaderboard, shows the wealthiest users based on their net worth and which place they are all in.
Once you are happy with where your net worth stands and don’t want to open more packs, you may log out.# NBA50k
